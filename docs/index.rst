`fmm3dbie <https://github.com/fastalgorithms/fmm3dbie>`_ 
is a set of libraries to solve constant coefficient elliptic boundary value
problems on surfaces in three dimensions.
The library currently supports Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value
problems for Laplace, Helmholtz, and Yukawa
equations on multi-core shared memory machines.
The library provides support for evaluating layer potentials on and
off the surface using locally corrected precomputed quadratures, 
FMM accelerated iterative solvers, interfaces for matrix entry
generation for dense and fast direct solvers.
The library is written in Fortran,
and has wrappers for Python.
As an example, given a domain $\Omega \in \mathbb{R}^{3}$ 
whose boundary is $\Gamma$,
and a function $g$ defined on $\Gamma$, the interior Dirichlet
problem for Helmholtz's equation is given by

.. math:: 
   
   (\Delta + k^2) u &= 0 \quad \mbox{ in } \Omega \, , \\
   u &= g \quad \mbox{ on } \Gamma \, .

We represent the solution $u$ in $\Omega$ using the combined field
representation 

.. math:: u = ik\mathcal{S}_{k}[\sigma] + \mathcal{D}_{k}[\sigma] \, ,

where $\sigma$ is the unknown density to be solved for, and 
$\mathcal{S}_{k}[\sigma]$ and $\mathcal{D}_{k}[\sigma]$ are the
Helmholtz single and double layer potentials given by

.. math::
   
   \mathcal{S}_{k}[\sigma](x) &= \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{\Gamma}
   \frac{e^{ik\|x-y\|}}{\|x-y\|} \sigma(y) dS_{y} \\
   \mathcal{D}_{k}[\sigma](x) &= \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{\Gamma}
   \nabla_{y} \frac{e^{ik\|x-y\|}}{\|x-y\|} \cdot n(y) \sigma(y) dS_{y} \, ,

and $n(y)$ is the normal to the surface $\Gamma$ at $y$. On imposing the
boundary conditions, we get the following integral equation for 
the unknown density $\sigma$

.. math::
   
   -\frac{1}{2} \sigma + ik S_{k}[\sigma] + D_{k}[\sigma] = g \quad
   x \in \Gamma \, .

The above integral equation then can be solved using an iterative solver
such as GMRES, where the layer potentials $ik S_{k}[\sigma] +
D_{k}[\sigma]$ are evaluated using FMM
accelerated locally corrected quadrature wrappers provided in this
library. 

The library currently supports high order triangulations of surfaces
stored in the .go3 format. In this setup each map from the standard 
right triangle is stored at order $p$ Vioreanu-Rokhlin nodes. 
The input format currently assumes that each patch is discretized using
the same order nodes. Upcoming support will be provided for
triangulations stored in .gmsh
format, and .step format.
